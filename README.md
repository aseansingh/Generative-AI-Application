By using PyCharm platform, a Flask web framework is used for the user interface of this AI chatbot application that utilizes the Cohere 
   command- r-plus model for natural language processing and Chroma for vector storage and retrieval. The Cohere API is configured
   with HuggingFaceEmbeddings and initializes the Chroma vector store for handling embedded data, supporting a retrieval-based
   question-answering chain. The application is tested using a predefined prompt template and a dataset created with Langchain and
   Cohere, with a Waitress server ensuring robust performance.
